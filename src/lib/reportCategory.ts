/**
 * Category for a test REPORT, read from the report itself -- never inferred
 * from requisitions (reports and requisitions are separate records; almost
 * every report is an older Excel/PDF import with no requisition at all).
 *
 * What a report can say about its own category:
 *
 *   1. A "Category: ..." note in its remarks. The bulk import copied the
 *      category written on the original sheet into remarks
 *      ("[Imported from H52.xlsx / 4] Category: EC Based"). Spellings vary
 *      ("Quatation test", "Ec Test", "R&D Trails"), so they're normalised
 *      onto the portal's six categories.
 *   2. Failing that, the EC / quotation number itself, when it is text that
 *      names a category ("NEW DIE PIN") or follows one of the portal's
 *      documented number schemes (EC/YY/1/... = EC Based, RIL/QT/... =
 *      Quotation Test -- see ecQuotationFormatHint in types/testing.ts).
 *
 * A plain numeric EC number is deliberately NOT used: the same kind of number
 * appears on both EC Based and Quotation reports, so it can't tell them apart.
 * Anything the report doesn't state lands in "none" -- shown as its own
 * bucket rather than guessed into a real category.
