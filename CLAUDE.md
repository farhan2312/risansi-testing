# Pump Testing Portal (testing-portal)

Internal web app for Risansi Industries Ltd's R&D / production testing team: intake pump testing requisitions, dedup-check against prior test reports, and fill/print test reports (Observation Sheet + Viscosity Correction Chart).

- **Repo:** `farhan2312/risansi-testing` on GitHub, `main` branch, deploy on push (Vercel).
- **Live URL:** `https://rndtesting.risansi.com`
- **Sister app:** `sales-portal-next` — separate Next.js app/repo, deployed separately on Vercel, but **shares this same Postgres database's `users` table and `JWT_SECRET`**. A login in either app works in both. Testing-portal does not own migrations for `users` (see Database section) — treat schema changes to that table with extra care since sales-portal-next depends on it too.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router), React, TypeScript.
- **Drizzle ORM** (`drizzle-orm/node-postgres`) against a shared **Azure Postgres** database, DB name `Pump_Selector_and_testing`.
- **react-hook-form + zod** for all forms.
- **JWT auth**, HS256, hand-rolled (no NextAuth) — see `src/lib/auth.ts`.
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing.
- No test framework wired up; verification is `npx tsc --noEmit` (type-check) plus manual/browser checks.

## Environment

`.env.local` (gitignored) must define:

```
DB_HOST=...
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=Pump_Selector_and_testing
DB_USER=...
DB_PASSWORD=...
DB_SSLMODE=require        # or "disable" for local
JWT_SECRET=...            # MUST match sales-portal-next's JWT_SECRET exactly
```

`src/lib/db/index.ts` builds the Postgres pool + Drizzle instance lazily (via a Proxy) so `next build` doesn't fail when creds aren't present at build time.

## Directory layout

```
src/app/(dashboard)/...        thin page.tsx wrappers, each just re-exports a screen:
                                  export { default } from "@/screens/xxx/XxxPage";
  dashboard/                    requisitions list
  requisitions/new, [id], [id]/edit, [id]/report
  reports/new, [id], [id]/edit
  admin/access-requests, admin/users
src/app/api/...                 route handlers (the actual backend)
  auth/login, auth/change-password
  access-requests                 (public signup -> pending user)
  requisitions, requisitions/[id], requisitions/dedup-check
  reports, reports/[id]
  users, users/[userId], users/[userId]/password
src/screens/                    the real page components (business logic + JSX)
src/components/test-report/     TestReportForm.tsx (Observation Sheet),
                                 ViscosityChartForm.tsx (Viscosity Correction Chart)
src/components/ui/               ConfirmModal, EditPasswordModal, AdminSetPasswordModal
src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx  sidebar + nav + profile menu, wraps every (dashboard) page
src/lib/db/schema.ts             Drizzle table defs
src/lib/auth.ts                  JWT create/verify, decodeToken(), requireAdmin()
src/lib/api.ts                   snake_case row serializers (userToDict, requisitionToDict, reportToDict, pointToDict)
src/lib/reportFieldMaps.ts       snake_case<->camelCase field maps for report PATCH/POST bodies
src/lib/testReportCalc.ts        the live formula engine (see below)
src/lib/reportDraft.ts           cross-form/cross-session draft carryover (SharedReportDraft)
src/services/                    client-side fetch wrappers (testingService, adminService, authService, session)
scripts/                         one-off .mjs migration/data scripts (see convention below)
```

## Auth & roles

JWT payload: `{ sub: userId, email, role, iat, exp }`, 12-hour expiry. `decodeToken(req)` verifies any valid token; `requireAdmin(req)` additionally requires `role === "admin"`.

Four roles (legacy `"user"` role fully retired):

| Role | Can do |
|---|---|
| **source** | Raise requisitions (sees only their own). Edit their own requisitions, but only intake fields (model, category, EC/quotation no., offer date, responsible person, source team, date of receipt, QTH/power/head/RPM/capacity) — not status/retest/testing-result fields. Cannot fill, edit, or delete reports. |
| **testing** | Cannot raise requisitions. Can Start Testing / mark Retest Needed, reassign "Responsible Person" inline from the requisitions list, fill/edit/delete reports. |
| **central-admin** | Same requisition-raising rights as source. **No** access to Manage Users / Access Requests (this was explicitly granted then revoked — do not re-add without asking). |
| **admin** | Everything, plus Manage Users (role changes, password reset, **delete user** — see FK gotcha below) and Access Requests (approve/reject signups). |

New-signup role is chosen on the Request Access form (Source Team / Testing Team only — central-admin/admin are never self-service). Every account defaults `must_change_password = true`; on login, `DashboardLayout` shows a **non-dismissible** `ConfirmModal`-style forced password-change if that flag is set — no close button, overlay click does nothing, cleared automatically on a successful change.

## Database gotchas (read before writing raw SQL or migration scripts)

1. **`users` table is a mirror.** Drizzle's `schema.ts` comment says testing-portal doesn't own its migrations (sales-portal-next does) — but testing-portal *has* added a column to it directly this session (`must_change_password`) via an additive migration script when needed. Coordinate/communicate before altering columns sales-portal-next relies on.
2. **Drizzle's `.default(...)` / `.$defaultFn(...)` are application-level only, not real DB defaults**, for most columns in this schema (`id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, etc.). Any **raw SQL** insert (migration script, ad-hoc fix) must explicitly supply `id` (`gen_random_uuid()`), `created_at`/`updated_at` (`now()`), etc. — omitting them throws `null value in column ... violates not-null constraint`. Only matters for scripts bypassing Drizzle; the app's own Drizzle inserts are fine.
3. **Real foreign keys exist that `schema.ts` does not model:**
   - `test_requisitions.created_by → users.id`
   - `users.reviewed_by → users.id` (self-referential — who approved/rejected an access request)
   Deleting a user who has ever raised a requisition or reviewed an access request will FK-violate unless those references are cleared first. `DELETE /api/users/[userId]` handles this in a transaction (nulls both, then deletes) — replicate that pattern if you add another user-deletion path. `test_requisitions.submitted_by` is a separate **name snapshot** column (not a FK), so requisition history stays human-readable even after the creator's account is gone.
4. **Migration script convention:** one-off `.mjs` scripts in `scripts/`, run via `npx dotenv -e .env.local -- node scripts/xxx.mjs`. Schema-altering scripts (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`) are additive-only and kept committed as a permanent record (`add-*-column.mjs`). Pure data-fix/debug scripts are deleted immediately after running — never leave throwaway scripts in the repo.

## Report formats & the formula engine

Two report formats share one `pump_test_reports` table (`report_format: "observation" | "viscosity-chart"`):

- **Observation Sheet** (`TestReportForm.tsx`) — capacity measured via V-notch / Barrel / Flow Meter.
- **Viscosity Correction Chart** (`ViscosityChartForm.tsx`) — same measurement methods, plus liquid-viscosity-corrected efficiency figures.

Both forms are **field-for-field identical** (as of this session) — gearbox/motor info, PO/EC no., NPSHa, rated capacity/head/RPM, specific gravity/viscosity/K, reference voltage/current, V-notch baseline, vibration test & run summary, Witness/Inspector/Recorder, Remarks. (Rev No./Rev Date were added then explicitly removed again — don't re-add without asking.)

`src/lib/testReportCalc.ts` is a **live formula engine ported exactly from the original Excel workbook** ("NEW PUMP TESTING FORMATE FOR DIGITAL", sheets "v notch" and "UPDATE SHEET V-NOTCH (2)") — every formula was verified against sample values baked into that workbook before porting. Only **K for Given CPS** actually feeds the slip/efficiency calculations; Specific Gravity and Viscosity (CPS) are informational fields on the original sheet too, not formula inputs — don't wire them into the calc without a concrete source formula.

Computed-not-editable fields (recalculated live from other inputs, not stored as free entry):
- **Total Run** = stop time − start time (`HH:MM hrs`).
- **Total Rise** = Max. Bearing Temp − Ambient Temp.

Creating a Viscosity Chart report linked to a requisition (or typing a matching model number) **auto-copies every shared field, including test points**, from that pump's existing Observation Sheet report — only into fields that are still empty, never clobbering something the tester already typed. See `applyAutofill` in `ViscosityChartForm.tsx` and `draftFromReport`/`SharedReportDraft` in `src/lib/reportDraft.ts`.

Test points in the report detail view are sorted by **head (kg/cm²) ascending** (RPM as tiebreaker) — historical/imported reports have head and RPM inversely related, so sorting by RPM first displayed head descending, which was confusing.

## Export PDF

`window.print()` with a `@media print` stylesheet — no PDF library. Print-only header block shows the Risansi logo; sidebar/action buttons hidden in print; `theme.css` forces light-theme CSS variables under `@media print` regardless of the viewer's dark/light mode. Witness/Inspector/Recorder render as a Role/Name/Signature table (Signature column is always a blank line, even if Name is filled in). **Known trap:** `.testing-layout`'s `height:100vh; overflow:hidden` (added for sidebar-scroll containment) must stay reset to `height:auto; overflow:visible` inside the print media query, or exported PDFs silently truncate after one screen's worth of content.

## Known UI/reliability landmines already fixed here (don't reintroduce)

- **Never use `window.confirm()`/`alert()` for anything that matters.** Browsers can silently suppress it (Chrome's "prevent this page from creating additional dialogs," some embedded/webview contexts) — it just returns `false` with no dialog and no error, so the destructive action silently never happens. Use `src/components/ui/ConfirmModal.tsx` instead for any new delete/destructive confirmation.
- **Don't trust a `useState(readFromLocalStorage())` lazy initializer alone** for anything that must reflect the *current* session state on every mount (e.g. `must_change_password`). It only runs once per component instance; pair it with a mount-time `useEffect` re-check (see `DashboardLayout.tsx`).
- Vercel occasionally serves a **"Vercel Security Checkpoint"** interstitial (bot/rate-limit protection) to rapid automated requests — a `403`/challenge page here is almost always that, not an app bug, if it clears up after backing off.

## Legacy data import

~250 historical pump-test reports were bulk-imported from old Excel/PDF exports this session. Reports are matched/searched by the **shop nickname on the source tab** (e.g. `H-85`), not the internal RTOH/RMOH-coded model number many of those sheets' headers actually show — those are two different things for most legacy sheets, confirmed the hard way. If asked to import more legacy data, expect the same landmine, and validate any parser against a report already confirmed correct in the DB before trusting it at scale.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # localhost:5174
npm run build             # production build (also runs lint + type-check)
npx tsc --noEmit           # type-check only, run this after every change before committing
npx dotenv -e .env.local -- node scripts/xxx.mjs   # run a one-off DB script
```

## Working conventions in this repo

- Commit + push to `main` after every change without waiting for extra confirmation (standing instruction).
- Type-check (`npx tsc --noEmit`) before every commit.
- Delete throwaway/debug scripts and test DB rows immediately after use — never leave them committed or lying around in the shared database.
- No browser-based QA loop after routine changes unless the user asks for it or you're actively debugging a live-reported bug (in which case: verify for real, including against the live deployment if needed, rather than declaring success on faith).
